Experience
----------

July 2021 - May 2024
:   **Senior Software Engineer at Sketch**

    For the first 2 years I worked as the single Backend Engineer for the **Prototype Team**. My duties for the team where to implement all the different Prototype features required such as **assets generation, regeneration on-demand, invalidation, and deletion from S3 buckets**. These features had to be implemented in different number of servies implemented in **Elixir and Go**.

    Afterwards, the teams got disolved and we started working on verticals. In my case, I was part of the **Web vertical**. During my time as part of the Web vertical I worked on multiple projects such as **permission groups, optimization of the rendering pipeline, optimization of the ingestion pipeline, workers to remove unused data from S3 buckets, etc**. These projects also required to modify or implement services in **Elixir and Go**.

April 2020 - July 2021
:   **Lead Software Engineer at Paack**

    During my time in Paack I have worked in multiple projects, such as **Warehouse Management System**, **Business Rules Engine**, **New Retailer API**, and **Communications Service**. All of them were developed in **Go** using **PostgreSQL** as the database to store the information of the services and they were deployed in **Kubernetes** using **Helm** and **Istio**.

    As part of my role as Lead Software Engineer I mentored several people in my team and I was heavily involved in the hiring process of the company.

June 2018 - April 2020
:   **Senior Backend Software Engineer at GlobalSign**

    As part of my duties in GlobalSign I implemented new functionalities in the **High Performance Platform**, written in **Go**, that served thousands of certificates per second. I also lead the migration of backend storage from **MongoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.

    I mentored multiple new-hires and had a highly involved role in the hiring process.

Sept. 2016 - June 2018
:   **Software Engineer at VCA Technology**

    During my time at VCA Technology I created a **network library** that allows the user to interact with **Boost ASIO** through the **std::stream** interface, added **authentication** to the system, and designed the **configuration migration process**.

    In addition, I improved the in-house **toolchain** to use **clang-tidy** for the linting of our code and I lead the usage of **continuous integration** in order to improve the product delivered to the customer, and to reduce the time to market.

April 2015 - Sept. 2016
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I worked in two projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -**Static analysis of code**: Checks if the code has some patterns such as: *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

    -**Dataflow analysis of code**: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handling, etc.

July 2013 - Apr. 2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    My main duty was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query for information about multiprotein complexes.
