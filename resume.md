Education
---------

2010-2013
:   **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science**; Universitat Jaume I (Spain)

    *Advanced Data Structures, Compilers and Interpreters and Distributed Systems*

2006-2010
:   **Associate Degree in Computer Science**; Universitat Jaume I (Spain)

    *Operating Systems,Real Time Operating Systems and Embedded Systems*

Experience
----------

2015-Present
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I have been working in a couple of projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -Static analysis of code: Checks if the code has some patterns that have an *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

     -Dataflow analysis of code: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handeling, etc.

2013-2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    One of my duties was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query our database to find information about multiprotein complexes.

    In addition, I developed an algorithm to cluster biological information from different kinds of proteins.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   All my personal development is done using and for Open Source. All my colaboration with Open Source projects can
be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/maitesin) account.

Manjaro Linux
:   I colaborate with the development of the Manjaro Linux distribution. I took part in the development of the hardware
detector to allow the user to install the right drivers.

[Prefix Tree](https://github.com/maitesin/tries)
:   I created a project to compare the performance in different *Prefix Tree* such as ***Trie***, ***Ternary Search
Tree*** and ***Radix Tree***. I used several cutting edge technologies like: C++11, Google Test (for unit test) and
[Conan](https://www.conan.io/) (for dependencies manager).

Linux Kernel
:   I have been studying the Linux Kernel from the beginning of 2015. First, I read books such as "*Understanding Linux Kernel*" and
"*Linux Decide Drivers*". Nowadays, I am taking the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

Personal blog
:   I have a personal blog where I write about different topics I think people can be interested in. Usually, it is about new technologies and how to use them or tricks and tips I found out resourceful or important. 

Programming Languages
:   **C++:** I have been using C++ for several years in different projects and technologies. For multithreaded
applications I used ***Pthreads*** and ***OpenMP***, I had some experience with ***MPI*** for distributed systems.
***C++11/14*** to explore the new features included. ***Boost*** to have access to the *filesystem*, *networking*, *smart pointers* and *testing/mocking*. ***Google Test*** to use it as a unit test framework without big dependencies. ***Conan*** as a dependency manager. ***CMake*** to build projects. ***GDB*** for debugging applications. ***Valgrind/Perf*** to measure performace and find bottlenecks. 

:   **C:** I used C for low level programming, such as ***Linux Kernel Drivers*** for Real Time Operating Systems [RTAI](https://www.rtai.org/) and to create a new scheduler using the [Rate-Monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-monotonic_scheduling) algorithm. Moreover, I used C in ***Embedded Systems*** to create applications to control industrial systems using ***Syscalls***.

:   Good knowledge of: **Python** and **Bash** with scripting purposes.

Languages
---------
Spanish
:   Native

English
:   Working knowledge
