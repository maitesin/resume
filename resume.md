Experience
----------

2016-Present
:   **Software Engineer at VCA Technology**

    At VCA Technology I worked in several projects:

    -A **network library** that allows the user to interact with **Boost ASIO** through the **std::stream** interface.

    -A tool to **improve the toolchain** used internally to allow the usage of **clang-tidy** for the linting of our code. And a tool that allows to **switch between several versions of the toolchain** without having to change the environment.

    -**Backend development** of several activities regarding the extension and implementation of new features in the backend of the product such as **Authentication**, **Configuration migration process** and **GStreamer** sinks.

    -Started the **integration testing** project that currently runs as part of the **continuous integration** system.

2015-2016
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I have been working in a couple of projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -**Static analysis of code**: Checks if the code has some patterns that have an *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

    -**Dataflow analysis of code**: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handling, etc.

    In addition, I had to take over two projects to refactor, maintain and add new features.

2013-2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    One of my duties was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query for information about multiprotein complexes.

    In addition, I developed an algorithm to cluster biological information from proteins.

2013-Present
:   **Open Source**

    I am actively contributing to open source projects that I find interesting and challenging. Some of my contributions can be found in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/maitesin).

:    **Linux Kernel**: I am interested in topics such as **Scheduler** and **Device Drivers**. I am currently taking the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).
:    **[Prefix Tree Comparison](https://github.com/maitesin/tries)**: Compare performance for different ***Trie***, ***Ternary Search Tree*** and ***Radix Tree***.
:    **[ARM C Compiler (ACC)](https://github.com/maitesin/acc)**: I am creating a **self-hosting compiler** for **C** in the **ARM** architecture.
:    **[Interactive CV](https://github.com/maitesin/rust-cv)**: I have created an interactive CV using **Rust** and **Docker**.
