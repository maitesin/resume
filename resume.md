Experience
----------

2018-Present
:   **Senior Backend Software Engineer at GlobalSign**

    As part of my duties in GlobalSign I implemented new functionalities in the **High Performance Platform** that serve thousands of certificates per second, and I took care of the migration of backend storage from **MongoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.

    Moreover, implemented a prototype of the system used in production running in **Kubernetes** to test the feasibility of a future migration.
    
    I mentored multiple new-hires and had a highly involved role in the hiring process. 

2016-2018
:   **Software Engineer at VCA Technology**

    During my time at VCA Technology I created a **network library** that allows the user to interact with **Boost ASIO** through the **std::stream** interface, added **authentication** to the system, and designed the **configuration migration process**.
    
    In addition, I improved the in-house **toolchain** to use **clang-tidy** for the linting of our code and I lead the usage of **continuous integration** in order to improve the product delivered to the customer, and to reduce the time to market.

2015-2016
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I worked in two projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -**Static analysis of code**: Checks if the code has some patterns that have an *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

    -**Dataflow analysis of code**: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handling, etc.

2013-2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    One of my duties was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query for information about multiprotein complexes.

    In addition, I developed an algorithm to cluster biological information from proteins.
