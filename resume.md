Education
---------

2010-2013
:   **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science**; Universitat Jaume I (Spain)

    *Advanced Data Structures, Compilers and Interpreters and Distributed Systems*

2006-2010
:   **Associate Degree in Computer Science**; Universitat Jaume I (Spain)

    *Operating Systems,Real Time Operating Systems and Embedded Systems*

Experience
----------

2015-Present
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I have been working in a couple of projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -**Static analysis of code**: Checks if the code has some patterns that have an *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

    -**Dataflow analysis of code**: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handeling, etc.

    In addition, I had to take over two projects to refactor, maintain and add new features.

2013-2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    One of my duties was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query for information about multiprotein complexes.

    In addition, I developed an algorithm to cluster biological information from proteins.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   All my personal development is done using and for Open Source. All my colaboration with Open Source projects can
be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/maitesin) account.

Agile Methodologies
:   I have experience working with **agile methodologies** such as **Scrum** and **Kanban**. Moreover, I work using techniques like **code review**, **pair programming** and **TDD**.

[Prefix Tree](https://github.com/maitesin/tries)
:   I created a project to compare the performance in different *Prefix Tree* such as ***Trie***, ***Ternary Search
Tree*** and ***Radix Tree***. I used several cutting edge technologies like: **C++11**, **Google Test** (for unit test) and
[Conan](https://www.conan.io/) (for dependencies manager).

[ARM C Compiler (ACC)](https://github.com/maitesin/acc)
:   I am working on creating a **self-hosting compiler** for **C** in the **ARM** architecture. I started this project to learn properly all the aspects of the **ARM** architecture and improve my **knowledge of compilers**.

Linux Kernel
:   I have been studying the Linux Kernel since the beginning of 2015. First, I read books such as "*Understanding Linux Kernel*" and
"*Linux Decide Drivers*". Nowadays, I am taking the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

[Personal blog](http://maitesin.github.io/)
:   I have a personal blog where I write about different topics I think people can be interested in. Usually, it is about new technologies and how to use them or tricks and tips I found out resourceful or important.

Programming Languages
:   **C++:** I have been using C++ for several years in different projects and with several technologies. ***C++11/14*** and ***Boost*** to explore the new features. ***Google Test/Mock*** to use it as a unit test framework without big dependencies. ***Conan*** as a dependency manager. ***CMake*** to build projects. ***GDB*** for debugging applications. ***Perf*** to measure performace and find bottlenecks.

:   **C:** I used C for low level programming, such as ***Linux Kernel Drivers*** for Real Time Operating Systems [RTAI](https://www.rtai.org/) and to create a new scheduler using the [Rate-Monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-monotonic_scheduling) algorithm.

:   **ARM:** I am learning the ***ARM assembly*** for ARMv8.

:   Good knowledge of: ***Python*** and ***Bash*** with scripting purposes.

Languages
---------
Spanish
:   Native

English
:   Working knowledge
