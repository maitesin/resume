> I am a software engineer with experience in all phases of the development process with special focus on delivering quality software to the costumers. I have experience in a diversity of projects ranging from a RESTful API processing thousands of requests per second, through compilers to video processing pipelines.

Experience
----------

June 2018 - Present
:   **Senior Backend Software Engineer at GlobalSign**

    As part of my duties in GlobalSign I implemented new functionalities in the **High Performance Platform** that serve thousands of certificates per second, and I took care of the migration of backend storage from **MongoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.

    Moreover, I implemented a prototype of the system used in production running in **Kubernetes** to test the feasibility of a future migration. As a side project I developed an **static analysis** tool to enforce the code style used in the company.
    
    I mentored multiple new-hires and had a highly involved role in the hiring process. 

Sept. 2016 - June 2018
:   **Software Engineer at VCA Technology**

    During my time at VCA Technology I created a **network library** that allows the user to interact with **Boost ASIO** through the **std::stream** interface, added **authentication** to the system, and designed the **configuration migration process**.
    
    In addition, I improved the in-house **toolchain** to use **clang-tidy** for the linting of our code and I lead the usage of **continuous integration** in order to improve the product delivered to the customer, and to reduce the time to market.

April 2015 - Sept. 2016
:   **Software Developer at Programming Research**

    I worked in two projects during my time at Programming Research.

    -**Static analysis of code**: Checks if the code has some patterns such as: *undefined behaviour*, *unspecified in the Standard*, and/or *implementation-defined*.

    -**Dataflow analysis of code**: Checks the complexity of methods, pointer problems, memory handling, etc.

July 2013 - Apr. 2015
:   **Software Engineer at European Bioinformatics Institute**

    My main duty was to create a RESTful service to allow users to query for information about multiprotein complexes.

    In addition, I developed an algorithm to cluster biological information from proteins.

2013-Present
:   **Open Source**

    I am actively contributing to open source projects that I find interesting and useful. Some of my contributions can be found in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/maitesin).

    These include, **[YAUS, Yet Another URL Shortener](https://github.com/maitesin/yaus)** is a toy project to play with **Flask** and **Heroku**, **[ARM C Compiler (ACC)](https://github.com/maitesin/acc)** is a **self-hosting compiler** for **C** in the **ARM** architecture, and **[Interactive CV](https://github.com/maitesin/rust-cv)** built using **Rust** and **Docker**.
