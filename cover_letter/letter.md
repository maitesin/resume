I am excited to be applying for the Senior Golang Engineer position at Elastic. As an experienced Software Engineer with proven experience in the Go, Python, and C++ languages and the GNU/Linux operating system I know that I can be a valuable asset for Elastic. Moreover, I have experience in Kubernetes, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ.

As an example of my knowledge in Go and Python you can have a look at my pet project [YAUS](https://yaus.dev). The first feature complete version of the project was written in [Python](https://github.com/maitesin/yaus/tree/e938b0d218849f50df7ab5a4a46923faf235762b), but then I decided to rewrite it in Go and apply some Domain Driven Design. In addition, I have some C and C++ repositories in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/maitesin). 

During my previous roles, I have always been involved in the design of RESTful and GraphQL APIs for the different services that were needed to be implemented to achieve the requirements provided. These APIs were designed with performance and scalability in mind from the start, not as an afterthought.

Thank you for you time and consideration. I am looking forward to learning more details about Elastic and about the Senior Golang Engineer role that you are hiring for. Should you need any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
